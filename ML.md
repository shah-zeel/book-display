# Server-Side (Node.js/Express):
1. Recommendation Logic: Implement the recommendation algorithm you have (KNN or SVD) using the ML model in the server directory. You can create a new file, for example, recommendations.js, and place the algorithm code there. This file should have functions to generate book recommendations based on the algorithm.
2. API Routes: In the routes/api/books.js file, create new routes to handle recommendation requests. You can add endpoints that trigger the recommendation logic and return the recommendations.

# Front-End (React):

1. BookCard Component: If you want to display the recommended books in a component, you can modify the BookCard.js component to handle the recommendations. You'll need to fetch the recommendations from the server and display them along with the existing book information.
2. Integration: Integrate the modified BookCard.js component into other parts of your application where you want to display recommendations.

# Connecting Everything:

1. Update your API routes in the React components to use the new recommendation routes you added in the Node.js/Express server.
2. Ensure that the book._id (or any other identifier you use) is correctly passed to the recommendation endpoint.
